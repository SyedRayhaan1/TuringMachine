# TuringMachine
Tursi is a Java-based application that simulates the operations of  a Turing machine, allowing users to define states, transitions, and  input strings. The simulator helps visualize Turing machine  computations step-by-step, making it a valuable tool for learning  and experimenting with theoretical computer science concepts.
