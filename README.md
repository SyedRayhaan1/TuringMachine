# TuringMachine
Tursi – Java Turing Machine Simulator
Overview
Tursi is a graphical Turing Machine simulator built in Java. It enables users to design, run, and visualize Turing Machines, making it a valuable educational tool for exploring concepts in theoretical computer science, automata theory, and the fundamentals of computation. The project features a clean Swing-based GUI, robust simulation engine, and support for custom machine configurations.

Features
Visual representation of the Turing machine tape, states, and transitions.

Interactive graphical interface using Java Swing.

Step-by-step or automated execution of Turing machine operations.

Support for custom Turing Machine definitions, including arbitrary states and transition functions.

Editable tape contents and starting conditions.

Clear error reporting and state visualization during simulation.

Modular code to support easy extension and experimentation.

Usage
Build and run the project in Eclipse or your preferred Java IDE.

Design a Turing Machine by specifying its set of states, input symbols, transition functions, and tape alphabet.

Enter the desired initial tape input or modify the tape manually.

Use the controls to run the machine step by step or execute automatically.

Visualize and analyze the Turing Machine’s behavior and results directly in the GUI.

Getting Started
Requirements
JDK 8 or higher

Eclipse IDE (or any Java-supporting IDE)

Running
Clone the repository or download the source code.

Import the project into Eclipse as an existing Java project.

Run the main class (typically Tursi.java or the designated launcher class).

The graphical user interface will appear, and you can begin creating and simulating Turing Machines.

Educational Use
Tursi is particularly useful for:

Students learning about automata and computability.

Instructors demonstrating Turing Machine theory in practical settings.

Anyone interested in deepening their understanding of how Turing Machines operate.
